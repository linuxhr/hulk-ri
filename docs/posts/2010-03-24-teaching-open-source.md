> Open Source is becoming a **dominant development model** in the software industry. The **next generation of software developers, computer scientists, system administrators, analysts, and build engineers** need to understand Open Source and must be **able to work efficiently within Open Source communities**. This is a neutral collaboration point for professors, institutions, communities, and companies to come together and make the teaching of Open Source a global success.
